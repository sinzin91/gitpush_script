# gitpush_script

This is to ease the process of pushing to git.

To use:
1) copy the script to your local machine
2) make the script executable `chmod +x gitpush.sh`
3) modify your path to add the directory where script is located `export PATH=$PATH:/appropriate/directory`
4) add this line to your .bash_profile or .zshrc `alias push='~/appropriate/directory/gitpush.sh'`

That's it! Now you can type `push` from within your repo to push to git.
